## Movie Review Classification

How to run my program?
I have used Jupyter Notebooks for implementing this assignment. Thus the output folder is a “ipynb” file.

Steps to Run:
Open Jupyter Notebooks
Click on this file to open
Go to Cells in the options above and select “Run All”

Note: The program should run perfectly fine having installed all the libraries of python installed in the system.
