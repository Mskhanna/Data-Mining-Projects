# K-Means Clustering

This folder contains two src codes. 
Part 1: Iris Dataset
Part 2: Image Dataset

How to run my program?
I have used Jupyter Notebooks for implementing this assignment. Thus the output folder is a “ipynb” file.

Steps to Run:
1. Open Jupyter Notebooks
2. Click on this file to open
3. Go to Cells in the options above and select “Run All”

I have used the following liabraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
from sklearn.metrics import  silhouette_score



Note: The program should run perfectly fine having installed all the libraries of python installed in the system.
